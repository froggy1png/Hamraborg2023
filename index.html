    <span>Designed by multidisciplinary artist Froggy Starr, Fruit Skeleton is a digital 3D series exhibited at Hamraborg Festival 2023. Created with the 3D software Blender and inspired by local history and culture, the work
encourages audiences to reflect on Hamraborg through AR play and visual storytelling.
The artwork references the many fruit machines in the area today and the history of Skeleton
Hill, where Hamraborg is now, named after the skeletons that were found there in 1940 by the
British Army, possibly the skeletons of those put to death during kumlateigur.</span>
